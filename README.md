# ANN-ensembles-for-financial-applications

Matlab code implementation for Using neural network ensembles for bankruptcy
prediction and credit scoring.

Specifically, the project aims at emulating the three methodological steps adopted
in the paper *Using neural network ensembles for bankruptcy prediction and credit
scoring*. The paper focuses on a comparative analysis between:

- Single classifiers;
- Multiple classifiers (with majority voting);
- Comparation of Accuracy measure and Type 1/2 error.

The analysis is executed on three different datasets, referred to bankruptcy data
and credit scoring. The datasets are referring to the Australian, German and Japanese
markets.


## I'm Using GitHub Under Protest

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS). I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
