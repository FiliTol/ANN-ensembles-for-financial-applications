Matlab code implementation for Using neural network ensembles for bankruptcy
prediction and credit scoring.

Specifically, the project aims at emulating the three methodological steps adopted
in the paper *Using neural network ensembles for bankruptcy prediction and credit
scoring*. The paper focuses on a comparative analysis between:

- Single classifiers;
- Multiple classifiers (with majority voting);
- Comparation of Accuracy measure and Type 1/2 error.

The analysis is executed on three different datasets, referred to bankruptcy data
and credit scoring. The datasets are referring to the Australian, German and Japanese
markets.
